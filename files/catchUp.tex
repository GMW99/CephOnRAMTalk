 \begin{block}{Catch up}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item File \& Object Storage
            \item Ceph 
            \item RAM
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
 \begin{block}{Where we are going}
 \begin{itemize}
     \item Cluster Deploy-able Storage (Transient Object Store)
     \item Performance 
 \end{itemize}
 \end{block}
\end{frame}

\note{So now we have a way of making Ceph run on RAM which is great, can we now make a Transient Object Store for data processing, which means that that can be created on the fly as and when we need it running in RAM}
